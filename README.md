# Randomized Algorithms

## Algorithms chosen

- Bogosort (lol)
- Randomized quicksort
- Miller-Rabin primality test
- Karger's Min-Cut
- RIC for Convex Hulls (computational geometry $\\cap$ randomized algorithms)

## Directory structure

- `<Algorithm-Name>` contains implementations of algorithms chosen and the relevant scripts for their evaluation (note the Pascal/Kebab case)
- `main_report/` contains the final report and all relevant images.

## Code running

If you want to run code (first of all, why?) check the algorithm-wise READMEs in their respective folders.
