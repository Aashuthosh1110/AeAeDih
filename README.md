# Randomized Algorithms

## Algorithms chosen

- Bogosort (lol)
- Randomized quicksort
- Miller-Rabin primality test
- Karger's Min-Cut
- RIC for Convex Hulls (computational geometry $\\cap$ randomized algorithms)

## Directory structure

- `alg/` contains implementations of algorithms chosen
- `eval/` contains scripts required for empirical evaluation of these algorithms
- `assets/` contains any other auxiliary files required
- `proposal/` and `report/` are self-explanatory and contain no code
