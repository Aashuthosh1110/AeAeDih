* File structure

The python files are what run and evaluate the algorithms, which are implemented in the C++ files. There is a singular PNG file with runtime plots.

* Running code

While you can run the C++ files individually with specific I/O formats, it's more advisable to just run
#+begin_src sh
  python3 benchmark.py
#+end_src
and wait for 5 years (jk it's like 5 mins) for the complete testing to finish.

If the C++ files absolutely have to be run, the I/O formats are as follows:
For both files, input newline-separated points which are space-separated coordinates. The output will be a similarly separated set of points which form the convex hull. There will also be a line before it about the time taken to compute the hull itself.
#+begin_src
  Input:
  
  x_1 y_1
  ...
  x_n y_n

  Output:

  Time: t
  x_i y_i
  ...
  x_j y_j
#+end_src
